# ðŸ“• About this project

This project aims to compare the price of calls with and without a plan.  Calls have their origin and destination with different area codes, which have a different rate for each minute of call.  Call plans cover a limited number of minutes, making the cost 0, except for minutes that exceed the number of minutes defined by the plan, these excess minutes have a 10% fee on the value of the minute.
